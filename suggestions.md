# Suggestions to improve the results

+ Count the new developments as flase positives

+ Work only on the historical town

+ Crop the Google logo out of the images

## Architecture change

In order not to use the Siamese architecture, which is more complicated, maybe use a blend of the couples instead

### Blending suggestions:

+ difference between each RGB value
+ blending using alpha 50% on both images
+ putting the images side to side

# Suggestions to improve the results

+ Count the new developments as false positives

+ Work only on the historical town

+ Crop the Google logo out of the images

In order not to use the Siamese architecture, which is more complicated, maybe use a blend of the couples instead

### Blending suggestions:

+ blending using alpha 50% on both images
